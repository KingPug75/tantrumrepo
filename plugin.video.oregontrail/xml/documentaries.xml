            <title>Old West Saloons of the 19th and Early 20th Centuries</title>
            <meta>
                <summary>In the American Old West, a saloon designates a caf or hotel. The first was established in 1822 at Brown's Hole, Wyoming, between Colorado and Utah, to serve trappers during the harsh fur season. The popularity of these establishments is attested by the fact that even a city of 3,000 inhabitants, such as Livingston (Montana), recorded up to 33 saloons in 1883.

Who goes to the saloon? Cowboys to negotiate cattle, drink alcohol, play poker... There are trappers, travelers, gold diggers, soldiers, lawyers, railwaymen ... The myth of the smoky saloon was born. Many saloons welcome their clients 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They are often accused of being propitious to scenes of "general fights", or pistol duels that end in shootings in the street or public hangings.

Take a look at these rare photos to see what real cowboys at saloons looked like in the 19th and early years of 20th centuries. </summary>

                <summary>THE ALAMO: THE REAL STORY (WILD WEST HISTORY DOCUMENTARY)

INVESTIGATES THE HISTORY, MYTH AND POPULAR CULTURE OF THE ALAMO!

On March 6, 1836 the 13-day siege of the Alamo ended. Among the dead were three men destined to become martyrs and heroes: David Crockett, James Bowie and William B. Travis. Cries of Remember the Alamo! would eventually fuel an American victory over Mexico. The Alamo and its defenders grew into enduring symbols of courage and sacrifice in the face of overwhelming odds.

Controversy has always been part of the history and legend of the Alamo. Whether they hold traditional or revisionist views, people are passionate about their opinions.

~Were Crockett, Travis and Bowie a "Holy Trinity" or less than perfect human beings?
~Why were Tejanos like Juan Seguin, who fought for Texas liberty alongside the Anglos, virtually ignored in history books until recently?
~How did Crockett die?
~Did Travis draw a line in the sand?
~How many defenders were really there, and how many attackers?
~Did everyone die, or were there survivors?

Since 1836, the Alamo and its heroes have been immortalized in countless poems, songs, plays, books and movies. The films of Walt Disney starring Fess Parker inspired a Davy Crockett craze that covered the nation with coon skin caps and merchandise ranging from games to salt shakers to ladies underwear. </summary>

            <meta>
                <summary>WYATT EARP - THE REAL STORY OF THE LEGEND (WILD WEST HISTORY DOCUMENTARY)

Wyatt Earp has been portrayed in countless movies and television shows by some of Hollywood's greatest actors, including Henry Fonda, Jimmy Stewart, and more recently, Kevin Costner, but these popular fictions often belie the complexities and flaws of a man whose life is a lens on politics, justice and economic opportunity in the American frontier.

As a young man, Wyatt Earp was a caricature of the Western lawman. He gained notoriety as the legendary gunman in the shootout at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona, but shortly after his death in 1929, distressed Americans down on their luck transformed Wyatt Earp into a folk hero, a central figure in the narrative of how the West was won. Celebrated as a man who took control of his own destiny, Wyatt Earp came to epitomize the town-taming marshal responsible for bringing the forces of law, order and civilization to the Wild West.

Wyatt Earp's actual life story, though, was more complicated than the romantic legend. He spent his youth carousing, gambling, and visiting brothels - sometimes just one step ahead of the law. A wanderer and an opportunist, Earp was ever in pursuit of greater fortunes in the next boomtown. He spent most of his life roaming the West, supporting himself with police work, mining, gambling, saloon-keeping, and real estate deals. After the tragic death of his young wife, Earp fell in among prostitutes and gamblers and remained closely connected to this underworld even after becoming a lawman. Soon after settling in the burgeoning silver mining town of Tombstone, Arizona, Wyatt Earp and his brothers became involved in a feud with the local Cowboys which culminated in the notorious 1881 Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

Though it lasted less than a minute, this infamous gunfight blurred the boundaries of law and criminality, and became a symbol a chapter in the winning of the West. In revenge for his brother's murder Earp took the law into his own hands, killing at least three of the local Cowboys before finally leaving the territory of Arizona for good.

In his later years, living in a small bungalow in Los Angeles, Wyatt Earp was haunted by his past, and fretted over his legacy. He died before he could witness his redemption as an enduring and admired hero in the American imagination. </summary>

            <title>Women Of The Wild West (OLD WEST HISTORY DOCUMENTARY</title>
            <meta>
                <summary>Women Of The Wild West (OLD WEST HISTORY DOCUMENTARY

Annie Oakley, Calamity Jane, Belle Starr, Pearl Hart: Toting guns, these women of the Wild West shot down the view that life as a female pioneer was about cooking, sewing, cleaning and caring for children.

Born during a time when women stood in the shadows of their rugged men, these trailblazers proved that they were as good - if not better - than their male counterparts. Some of them became legends as outlaws, shocking society with their ruthless and unladylike behavior.

Martha "Calamity Jane" Canary epitomized this tough rebellious character. Hard-drinking, gun-slinging and bragging of her exploits, she often posed as a man to get ahead. Travelling to the West at the age of 13 with her parents, she eschewed the traditional female role and spent most of her time with the men and joining hunting parties. As Calamity Jane describes it, she was commended by the others as a remarkably good shot and a fearless rider. Later she worked as a scout, donning the male uniform and fighting the Indians.

Earning the reputation of being able to handle a horse better than most men and shoot like a cowboy, she toured with Buffalo Bill Cody and Sitting Bull in the Wild West Show.

Annie Oakley, also made famous in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, proved a remarkable skill with a gun and made a career for herself that many never imagined could have been done by a woman.

Unlike Calamity Jane, though, Annie Oakley, the Quaker, retained her feminine style of dress with a calf-length skirt, long sleeves and leggings, making it her trademark.

While Calamity Jane and Annie Oakley wielded a gun, they never used it as a threat - unlike outlaws Pearl Hart and Belle Starr.

Pearl Hart was inspired by the strong women of the west, particularly Annie Oakley with whom she became enamoured after seeing her perform. Leaving her children at home in Canada, Hart moved to Arizona and soon found herself engaged in criminal activity as a solution to her financial woes.

It began with minor theft - luring men into her room, after which they'd be knocked out and robbed. Soon Hart and her partner Joe Boot were planning a more elaborate heist - robbing the stagecoach that ran between Florence and Globe, Arizona. While Joe Boot held up the driver, Pearl Hart - with her hair cut and dressed as a man - robbed the passengers.

They were caught, she escaped from jail, and the "Bandit Queen" legend was born.

At her trial she famously expressed her feelings on women's rights, saying: "I shall not consent to be tried under a law in which my sex had no voice in making."

The most famous "Bandit Queen" was Belle Starr, whose association with Jesse James and the Younger brothers, and her extensive list of illegal activity, made her one of the most notorious female outlaws in the Wild West.

Having no use for long, restrictive Victorian dresses, Belle Starr wore buckskins and boots, a man's Stetson hat with an ostrich plume, and proudly displayed her pistols. When not dressing as a man and committing robbery, legend says she spent her time in saloons, drinking and gambling and galloping down streets with guns blazing.

When her husband Jim Reed was shot by a deputy sheriff after being in custody for a stagecoach robbery, Belle put her children in the care of relatives and took up a variety of illegal activities - organizing robberies and harboring criminals. In and out of courts and prison, Belle's life ended in a suitably dramatic fashion: shot in the back while riding home from the store to her ranch.

The incredible tales of these women became folklore, their exploits romanticized and exaggerated in dime novels and later in the musical and motion picture industries.

Though the line between fact and imagination is blurred and often difficult to separate, one thing is clear: these women of the Wild West were pioneers in their own way, challenging the traditional roles of women in the 19th century. </summary>

Strap on your six-shooter! It's time to walk the dangerous, dusty streets of the most notorious towns of America's wild frontier.

For a brief period anarchy reigned in America. In just a quarter of a century - from about 1865 to 1890 - a fundamental facet of our national persona took shape in the untamed lands beyond the American frontier. Characterized by lawless gambling towns, frenzied gold rushes, and legendary racketeers, the Wild West was rich with opportunities for those quick with their wits or their guns.

But what was life really like in the Old West? SIN CITY OF THE WEST explores the physical evidence left by this often myth-clouded chapter in American history. Contemporary accounts - such as newspaper reports of superhuman exploits and uncorroborated memoirs written as promotional materials - are notoriously unreliable, so LOST WORLDS goes straight to the sources: recent excavations, archival documents and scientific analysis.

What LOST WORLDS reveals is a society just as thrilling and as we've always imagined, but far more sophisticated and varied than the image we've received from Hollywood. With trademark vividness, computer reconstructions transport you to a time when legends were made and our national character was formed.

Walk the dusty streets and prepare for a showdown in the SIN CITY OF THE WEST! </summary>

                <summary>Gunfight at the OK Corral (WILD WEST HISTORY DOCUMENTARY)

In 1881 Virgil Earp,marshal of Tombstone, suspects Billy Clanton and the McLaury brothers of stealing cattle and,backed up by his brothers Wyatt and Morgan and 'Doc' Holliday,challenges them to surrender near the OK corral. In the following thirty second shoot-out the suspected and unarmed thieves are shot in the back,leading to the Earps standing trial for murder - though they are exonerated by the judge,who also happens to be a relation. This retelling,along with commentaries,is a far darker version of the story in which the Earps are usually represented as the unequivocally good guys. </summary>

                <summary>THE REAL HISTORY OF THE GOLD RUSH (OLD WILD WEST DOCUMENTARY)

At the end of 1853, San Francisco was a city on the fast track. A few years earlier, the seaside town had been a sleepy village of just 800 people. But the sight of gold in the waters of the American River set the stage for an event that would forever change a city, a fledgling state, and the nation. Incorporating rare and exquisite daguerreotypes and original recreations, this film offers a vivid portrait of a seminal event in America's history. </summary>

                <summary>BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE OUTLAW TRAIL (OLD WILD WEST HISTORY DOCUMENTARY)

The Wild Bunch, the confederation of western outlaws headed by Butch Cassidy, found sanctuary on the rugged Outlaw Trail. Stretching across Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, this trail offered desert and mountain hideouts to bandits and cowboys. The almost inaccessible Hole-in-the-Wall in Wyoming was a station on the Outlaw Trail well known to Butch Cassidy. To the south, in Utah, was the inhospitable Robbers Roost, where Butch and his friends camped in 1897 after a robbery at Castle Gate. </summary>
